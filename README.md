## Overview

A simple, responsive mini calculator made using vanilla JavaScript, with features to handle invalid input, clear or delete entries, and evaluate expressions safely.

### The challenge

- Build out a functional calculator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Allow users to:
  - Input numbers and operations
  - Clear the entire input
  - Delete the last digit
  - Get accurate calculations
- Bonus: Handle invalid inputs and edge cases like empty input or division by zero

### Features

- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- `Clear` button to reset the input
- `DEL` button to delete the last digit
- Shows `0` if user presses equals without input
- Styled input field with custom focus behavior
- Optionally uses `math.js` for safer expression evaluation

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- [math.js](https://mathjs.org/) (optional for safer calculations)

### What I learned

- How to safely evaluate math expressions using `math.js`
- Handling edge cases like empty inputs or invalid math
- Customizing focus styles in form elements

```html
<input name="number" placeholder="0" id="display" readonly>

```
```css
input:focus{
  outline: none;
}
```
### Continued development

- Add keyboard support (use numbers and Enter key)
- Improve layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Add light/dark theme toggle
